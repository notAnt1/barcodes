## Write-up

### Part 2.1: Old Hat, New Hat

1. With your partner, brainstorm a list of (a) useful functions over strings you’ve used in other languages and (b) operations, i.e., common programming patterns, over strings.

Useful functions include length functions, string comparison functions, string copy functions, parsing functions, iterating through strings. 

For each entry in your list, peruse the String class documentation and try to find an equivalent String method that performs the function/operation in question. If you can’t find such a method, write a code snippet that performs the same effect.

String comparison is string.compareTo(), string copy is string.copyValueOf(), parsing from string to int is Integer.parseInt(n), and iterating through strings is to convert it into an array of characters and then using a for loop.
